// AJAX ----> Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
// with ajax web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously(in the background) without enterfering with the display and behaviour of existing webpage

// we don't use data in XML format anymore
// we use JSON now

// we have 3 most common ways to create and send request to server
// i) xmlHTTPRequest (old way of doing)
// ii) fetch API (new way of doing)
// iii) axios (third party library)
